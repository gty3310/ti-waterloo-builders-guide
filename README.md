# 🌟 Waterloo Builder & Startup Guide

A short guide for entrepreneurs, builders, and tech people interested in exploring Waterloo.

## 🏙️ Why Waterloo?

Waterloo has long supported entrepreneurs with resources, mentors, and friendships.  
It may not be everyone’s permanent base — but it’s certainly a place worth returning to.  

What stands out most is the culture:  
- People connect warmly, without status or hierarchy  
- Mentorship and advice are shared generously, not transactionally  
- The scale of the city makes it easy to build meaningful relationships  
- Startup projects often come from a close-knit circle of people building together

## 🗺️ Ecosystem Highlights

Here are some of the spaces, communities, and programs that make Waterloo unique (my pitch-style descriptions):  

- **Socratica** — weekly Sunday co-working for young makers, a grassroots movement born here  
- **Builders Club** (with StartupCamp, AI Thinkers, AI Collectives & more) — a community-led co-working hub for very early-stage entrepreneurs (think the “-1 to 0” stage, like SF’s South Park Commons)  
- **Hackathons** — *Hack the North*, *EngHacks*, *JAMHacks*, and more keep the maker spirit alive year-round  
- **Akatos Hacker House** — a living room with couches where local & global founders (and VCs) hang out, collaborate, and sometimes crash overnight  
- **Velocity Dungeon, Velocity Digital, WLU StartUp Lab** — student-driven startup spaces, open and welcoming to the broader community  
- **Accelerator Centre, Velocity, Communitech** — incubators that help startups access resources and connect with opportunities  
- **Den 1880 & Catalyst 137** — co-working offices that connect the broader community and scale-up companies
