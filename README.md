## 🏙️ Why Waterloo?

Waterloo has long supported entrepreneurs with resources, mentors, and friendships.  
It may not be everyone’s permanent base — but it’s certainly a place worth returning to.  

What stands out most is the culture:  
- People connect warmly, without status or hierarchy  
- Mentorship and advice are shared generously, not transactionally  
- The scale of the city makes it easy to build meaningful relationships  
- Startup projects often come from a close-knit circle of people building together

## 🗺️ Ecosystem Highlights

Here are some of the spaces, communities, and programs that make Waterloo unique (my pitch-style descriptions):

- [**Socratica Symposium**](https://welcome.socratica.info/) — annual showcase event that gathers the community  
- [**Builders Club**](https://buildersclub.ca/) (with StartupCamp, [AI Tinkerers](https://waterloo.aitinkerers.org/), [AI Collective](https://www.aicollective.com/), & more) — a community-led co-working hub for very early-stage entrepreneurs (think the “-1 to 0” stage, like SF’s South Park Commons)
